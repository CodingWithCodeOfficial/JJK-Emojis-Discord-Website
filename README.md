# JJK Emojis Discord Server – Website

This repository contains the **promotional website** built for a **Jujutsu Kaisen-themed Discord server**.  
The site was created as a commission to help market the server, showcase its offerings, and direct visitors to join the community.

**Important:** This website is **not** the Discord server itself, nor a bot or emoji pack it is a dedicated landing page designed to represent and promote the server online.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Website

The goal of this website is simple and intentional:

- Present the Discord server in a professional and appealing way
- Highlight what makes the server unique
- Give visitors a quick understanding of the community
- Provide a clear call-to-action that sends users directly to the Discord invite

This mirrors how many Discord communities use external websites to grow their audience beyond Discord itself.

## 🧠 Commission Context

This site was built for a Discord server owner as a **commissioned project**.  
The focus was on:

- Matching the server’s anime / Jujutsu Kaisen theme
- Keeping the site visually engaging without being cluttered
- Making it easy for visitors to join the server in one click
- Delivering a clean, easy-to-host static website

## 🏗 How the Website Was Built

The development process prioritized presentation and user flow over complex backend logic.

### 1. Planning the Experience
The site was structured around how a new visitor would think:

- What is this server?
- Why should I join?
- What does it offer?
- Where do I click to join?

These questions guided the layout and section order.

### 2. Frontend Implementation
Built using standard web technologies:

- **HTML** – Structure and content sections
- **CSS** – Styling, layout, and thematic design
- **JavaScript** – Light interactivity (where needed)

The design emphasizes readability, clear sections, and strong visual hierarchy.

### 3. Server Showcase Elements
The site lightly showcases:

- The server’s theme and vibe
- Key features and highlights of the community
- Visual elements that reflect the Jujutsu Kaisen aesthetic
- A prominent Discord invite button

The primary goal is **conversion** — getting visitors to join with minimal friction.

### 4. Deployment & Sharing
The website is designed for easy hosting on static platforms such as:

- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel

This allows the server owner to share a professional link anywhere (social media, Discord bios, etc.).

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript** (minimal, for interactivity)
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and hosting

No heavy frameworks were used — keeping the site fast, lightweight, and accessible.

## 📌 What This Repository Represents

This repository demonstrates:

- Building a marketing-style landing page
- Client/commission-based web development
